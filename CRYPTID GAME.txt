CRYPTID GAME

A top-down stalking game where you, a monster, have to murder a bunch of plucky teens in the forest before daybreak.

GOAL:

Eat all the teens before time runs out, don't get caught on camera

GAME FLOW:

1) spawn in your lair with your selected cryptid
2) explore for a little bit until you find the teens (audio & visual cues)
3) OPTIONAL: explore more and set traps in likely places
4) make spooky noises to lure teens, isolate them and catch them in your traps
	-extra points for inciting fear and not being photographed
	-extra extra points if you drag the teens back to your lair before eating them
5) you win when all teens are dispatched

CRYPTID ABILITIES:

1) MAKE SPOOKY NOISE
2) SET TRAP
3) INCAPACITATE TEEN
4) DRAG INCAPACITATED TEEN
5) EAT INCAPACITATED TEEN

-you can incite fear by being glimpsed, being fully seen when the teen has no camera, and making spooky noises

TEEN ABILITIES:

1) TAKE PHOTOGRAPH
2) SHOUT (cry out/warn others)
3) SPRINT
	4) START FIRE? (nice-to-have)
	
TEEN BEHAVIOURS:

1) IDLE (around the campfire, for example)
	a) run non-random timer, look around at set intervals
		i) if noise detected, goto INVESTIGATE
		ii) if cryptid glimpsed, goto INVESTIGATE
		iii) if cryptid seen, goto PHOTOGRAPH

2) INVESTIGATE (source of spooky noise/shout)
	a) move towards source of noise
		i) if cryptid is spotted, if fear is below set threshold, PHOTOGRAPH, else, FLEE

3) PHOTOGRAPH
	a) raise camera with short delay, then photograph cryptid
		i) if raycast to cryptid is blocked by SOLID OBJECT, then photograph fails
		ii) if raycast to cryptid is blocked by PARTIAL COVER, then photograph is blurry
		iii) if raycast to cryptid is not blocked, then GAME OVER

4) FLEE
	a) run in opposite direction to cryptid for X distance, then LOOK FOR FRIENDS
	
5) LOOK FOR FRIENDS
	a) orient self in general direction of friends (45 degree radius, chance to miss completely)
	b) set destination correct distance to friends, + or - 10 metres so teen will eventually, probably make it to friends
		i) if see another teen, move to near them and IDLE.

6) INCAPACITATED
	a) wiggle and make quiet noises
